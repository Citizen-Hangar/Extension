  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: December 20, 2025.</p>
  <p>This extension helps synchronize pledge information from <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com">robertsspaceindustries.com</a> with the Citizen Hangar service (<a href="https://citizenhangar.space">citizenhangar.space</a>).</p>
  <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pairing token (EAT):</strong> a token returned by the Citizen Hangar server when you pair the extension. Stored locally in extension storage to authorize syncs.</li>
    <li><strong>Pledge page HTML:</strong> when you run a sync, the extension collects HTML from your RSI pledges pages and posts it to the Citizen Hangar server for processing. The extension does not retain copies beyond local logs unless you explicitly keep them on the remote service.</li>
    <li><strong>Local debug logs:</strong> debug logs are stored in extension storage and can be cleared from the extension UI.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>How We Use Data</h2>
  <p>Data is used only to associate your RSI pledges with your Citizen Hangar account and to provide the dashboard features. We do not sell or share your data with third parties outside of the Citizen Hangar service.</p>
  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Sync targets data is sent to <a href="https://citizenhangar.space">citizenhangar.space</a>. Please review their privacy practices.</p>
  <h2>Your Controls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can revoke pairing (which removes the stored token) from the extension UI.</li>
    <li>You can clear local logs from the extension UI.</li>
    <li>Enable developer mode to point the extension at a local server for testing.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>For questions, see the project repository or contact the maintainers via the Citizen Hangar website.</p>
